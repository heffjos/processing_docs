# Processing Docs

This is the github repo that I am hosting the labs processing docs from. It is built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). 

There are many plugins enabled that are taken from the reference below:

The site can be tested locally using `mkdocs serve` and it is deployed using `mkdocs gh-deploy`
